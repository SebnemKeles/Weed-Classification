# 🌿 Weed Classification Using Image Processing


## 🧠 Project Summary
This project tackles the binary classification of weed species — **charlock** and **cleavers** — using classical image processing and machine learning techniques. It is based on a simplified version of the [Kaggle Plant Seedlings Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-seedlings-classification).


## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy / OpenCV / Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib


## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Resize, Normalize, Grayscale
   - Histogram equalisation, Edge dedection

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Mean RGB values
     
3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN
  
4. **Hyperparameter tuning**
   - GridSearchCV

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
   - Confusion Matrix 


## 🧪 Results

| Model                | Accuracy 
|----------------------|----------
| Logistic Regression  | 82%    
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | 56%    
| K Nearest Neighbours | 76%

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Use CNNs for automatic feature learning
- Test on larger/more varied datasets
